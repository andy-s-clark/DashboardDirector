Dashboard Director
===========

| **tl;dr**
| A web interface for dashboard deployments.

Dashboard Director is a Python/Django project that allows you to deploy code stored in source control (a project) to a target server (host).
Dashboard Director provides convenient web interfaces to configure both the projects and the hosts. Additionally, deployment history and
logs are stored so that you know who, what, where, when, and why something was deployed.
